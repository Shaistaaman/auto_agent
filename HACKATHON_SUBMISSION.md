# Autonomous Agent - Autonomous Incident Responder for DevOps

## Inspiration

The inspiration for our Autonomous Incident Responder came from witnessing countless sleepless nights of DevOps engineers manually troubleshooting production incidents. We've all been there - getting paged at 3 AM because a server is down, spending precious hours diagnosing the same recurring issues, and watching Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) stretch from minutes to hours while business-critical systems remain offline.

The breaking point was realizing that 70-80% of incidents follow predictable patterns with well-documented remediation steps, yet teams still waste valuable time on manual diagnosis and response. We envisioned an AI agent that could think like a senior DevOps engineer - analyzing context, consulting runbooks, making informed decisions, and taking action autonomously while knowing when to escalate to humans.

With the power of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, we saw an opportunity to create an intelligent system that doesn't just monitor - it acts, learns, and continuously improves incident response.

## What it does
